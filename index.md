# 📊 Kill-Count - Your Go-To Horror Movie Database

## 🎉 About Kill-Count

**Step 2:** Once you are on the Releases page, you will see a list of available files. Look for the latest version, which will have the most up-to-date body count data.

**Step 3:** Click on the file you want to download. For most users, the JSONL file format will be the best choice. It is easy to read and can be used with most data analysis tools.

**Step 5:** Depending on your needs, you can now open this file with your preferred text editor, spreadsheet software, or data analysis tool. 

## 📦 File Format
The data is provided in JSONL format, which stands for JSON Lines. Each line of the file contains a separate entry for a horror movie, including details like the title, release year, and body count. 

### Example of a JSONL Entry
```
{"title": "Halloween", "year": 1978, "body_count": 5}
{"title": "Scream", "year": 1996, "body_count": 4}
```
This format ensures that the data is both easy to read and easy to parse for analysis.
